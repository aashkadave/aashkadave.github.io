<h1>Mexican Food in the UK</h1>

<h4>Anecdotally speaking, there's not much Mexican food in the UK. Some would go so far as to say the situation is sad, others would say it's desperate. This set of charts attempts to shed light on this mystery, by focusing on a single question:</h4>
<h4>Is Mexican food in the UK a thing?</h4>

<p> To find out if anecdotal experience aligns across borders, I asked several individuals what they thought about the present Mexican-food-in-UK-situation. Here's what they had to say:</p>

<blockquote>“When I joyfully studied abroad in the UK in 2013, I expected uniform [i.e., mostly British] food. But I wasn’t emotionally prepared for the lack of Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine. My overall experience was amazing. But queso access would have made the trip extraordinary.” -Anonymous, from Georgia</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In the UK [burritos] are basically luxury snack food for middle or upper class people working at Canary Wharf (basically British Wall Street)."-Anonymous, from the UK</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Well there are good Mexican-*inspired* restaurants..."-Anonymous, from the UK</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It just wasn't there. The best we found had a substitute for every ingredient — the queso tasted like it was made of Camembert, and the salsa smelled distinctly of Italian herbs. Wrong vibe."- Anonymous, from the US</blockquote>

<p>So how can we go about figuring out whether Mexican food is a Thing Thing in the UK? Thanks to Jay Rayner, we have some options!</p>

<p> Of course, this begs a question: who is Jay Rayner?</p>

<p>Jay Rayner is a food critic and reviewer for The Guardian, and has been so for a very long time. His reviews are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jayrayner">prolific</a> (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/09/le-cinq-paris-restaurant-review-jay-rayner">and often comical</a>). Since he's been around for so long, we're using his food reviews as a benchmark.</p>

<p>Does Jay Rayner, Voice of British Food Reviews and Tastes, talk about Mexican food? If yes, how? And what does this mean for those of us who go to the UK and just want a good taco?</p>

<h2>"Food" and "Taco" Overall</h2>

<p> Let's start large: how often do the words "food" and "taco" appear in The Guardian in any given year?</p>

    <div id="viz_foodtaco1"></div>

<p> It looks like folks at The Guardian love talking about food. Tacos? Not so much, though there has been a slight uptick in recent years.</p>

<h2>"Food" and "Taco" As Told By Jay Rayner</h2>

<p> Let's zoom in a bit now: how often does Jay Rayner mention "food" or "taco"? This graph shows the number of times "Jay Rayner" appears in a given article alongside either "food" or "taco."</p>

    <div id="viz_foodtacojr"></div>

<p>It would appear that a) Jay Rayner has little love for tacos, b) there are no Mexican restaurants for him to review, or c) readers of The Guardian have little interest in hearing about tacos.</p>

<h2>Cuisines, As Told by Jay Rayner</h2>

<p>We're zooming in even further now. This graph looks at how often Jay Rayner mentions specific phrases related to given cuisines: French Food, Indian Food, Chinese Food, and Mexican Food.</p>

    <div id="viz_prejayrayner"></div>

<p>Please note how, between 2005 and 2009, Jay Rayner there were only TWO articles that mentioned both Jay Rayner and the phrase "Mexican food."" Two!</p>

<h2>Cuisines, As Told By Jay Rayner, Part 2</h2>

<p>A closer zoom: Here we have the occurrence of specific cuisine phrases between 2010 and 2016. "Mexican Food" is gaining some traction, but not very much.</p>

    <div id="viz_jr_cuisines"></div>

<p>In recent years, mentions of "Mexican food" have increased. Perhaps we can keep our fingers crossed?</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>In 2011, a Quora user asked
  <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Mexican-food-in-the-UK-so-bad">
    Why is Mexican food in the UK so bad?"
  </a>
</p>

<p>It would appear that it's seemingly not a common food, or that folks in the UK aren't interested in it. Sure, it would be very hard to get a good avocado to the UK (#thanksAtlanticOcean). That being said, someone with a penchant for tacos and some business savvy might find themselves with a ripe opportunity.</p>
